# simple-tabs-project

In front-end development, tabs are UI elements that let users switch between different sections of content without leaving the page. They keep information organized and improve user experience.

For this project, I used a data-set / data-for-tab mechanism to link each tab button to its corresponding content. This made the logic cleaner, more dynamic, and easier to extend. Using JavaScript DOM manipulation, I handled switching the active tab and updating the displayed content.

I also added a smooth CSS transition on the tab labels to show which tab is active by clicking the tab labels - just a subtle animation, but it makes the interface feel more polished and interactive.
